# UoB Maths Problems Respository

The dream being persued here is to have a great revision resource - a large number of problems available and filterable by module and topics. The idea is that with a number of people using the tool, and if each of them are also spending some time to contribute to adding problems/solutions, then there is a large mutual benefit.
