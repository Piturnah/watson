# UoB Maths Problems Respository

The dream being persued here is to have a great revision resource - a large number of problems available and filterable by module and topics. The idea is that with a number of people using the tool, and if each of them are also spending some time to contribute to adding problems/solutions, then there is a large mutual benefit.

The live server with the problem database is unfortunately private as I'm unsure of the legality of hosting the problems publically. If you are a maths student at UoB, get in touch.
